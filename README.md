To use the training pipeline
1. Use the numpy_reconstruction to change files from NETCDF4 to numpy files (will be in Cartesian coordinates)
2. Use the numpy_change to create the same file in polar coordinates
3. Run the LSTM.py script (Check directories listed and additional files are stored)
4. To visuale output run LSTMSave.py
5. For only validation set metrics then run LSTMEval.py
